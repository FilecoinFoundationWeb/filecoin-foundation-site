## Submissions to Wave 6 grant proposals are due January 15, 2021 for priority consideration. We will continue to evaluate new proposals after that deadline as capacity allows. [See here for the full list of proposals we are seeking to fund](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#submit-a-proposal-for-open-grants). 

As the Filecoin Ecosystem continues to grow, more projects are being developed that facilitate an exciting range of storage applications, developer tools and integration experiments.

In addition to the recent launch of Fil+ to maximize incentives for storing useful data on Filecoin, and Phase 2 of the ongoing Slingshot storage competition, Filecoin Dev Grant projects are also paving the way for interesting use cases and tooling for the protocol. Over the past year, the Dev Grant program has awarded about 40 projects to date, out of 140 total proposals submitted by the community.
