GainForest founder David Dao states, “Nature-based solutions need to be permanent and transparent for stakeholders. That is why it is so crucial that the data…must be permanent and transparent as well. Decentralized data storage guarantees just that. At any point in time, anyone everywhere in the world can look up, reproduce, and audit our analysis. Low-quality projects can’t hide anymore in static PDFs.”",

For instance, Sunmin Kim, fellow and alumni with Sen. Brian Schatz, led the effort to pass the OPEN Government Data Act into law in 2018 and 2019. The law requires all non-sensitive federal government data to be open and machine readable, and requires every federal agency to create a Chief Data Officer.",
