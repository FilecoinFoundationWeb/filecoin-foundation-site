Each iteration of the award has its own $50,000 pool. The program encourages local civic technology groups to store and/or access their community data sets on the decentralized web. The Public Data awards are specific to locations centered around governments with which Filecoin Foundation is partnering.<br><br>The award is intended to fund anything from a project analyzing air quality data recently uploaded to Filecoin to an educational seminar about how to access and use your city’s data stored on Filecoin or IPFS. To maximize public learning, all awards should result in at least one public output or outcome (e.g., a blog, event, data tool).<br><br>Note: This Awards program is contingent on the support and involvement of local government officials.",
