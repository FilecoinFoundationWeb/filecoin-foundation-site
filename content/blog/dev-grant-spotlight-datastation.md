_This is the latest post in our series highlighting the builders and innovators creating new tools and services on the Filecoin network._ [_Learn more_](https://grants.filecoin.io/) _about the Filecoin Foundation’s Dev Grants program, and_ [_read up_](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-wave-9-developer-grant-recipients-d3f92868ba1f) _on Wave 9 recipients._

DataStation is a platform that enhances the decentralized storage experience on the Filecoin network by providing storage providers and clients with standardized storage performance data in a format that's both easy to store and to understand. This information aids clients in building the right plan for their storage needs and bridges the gap between decentralized storage providers and enterprise clients seeking to leverage the Filecoin network for data storage.

In 2020, [BUIDL Labs](https://buidllabs.io/), the team behind DataStation (formerly Miner Marketplace), was awarded a developer grant to complete three milestones to update its tools and capabilities and create bottom-line impact for storage providers, enterprise clients, and the ecosystem as a whole. First, DataStation is building a basic profile with front- and back-end specifications; this will raise awareness of potential data or stability challenges. Second, the DataStation team is looking to standardize listings for different profiles by integrating authentication methods and adding subjective metrics to the profile. Finally, DataStation will integrate storage provider earnings and stress testing functionality before beta launching the platform.

DataStation occupies a unique corner of the marketspace because it can break down storage providers’ information to provide qualitative and quantitative data about their performance in a personalized, jargon-free way. It makes storage provider performance analytics simple and more effective. This allows all storage providers in the ecosystem, regardless of experience or knowledge, to be fully aware of how their network is performing, and to make necessary adjustments to ensure the success of their own business as a storage provider and provide the highest quality of service and functionality to clients within the ecosystem.

The platform helps users find the right storage provider for individualized use cases and requirement sets. It also offers a built-in quote calculator that helps prospects choose a storage provider that fits their budget and storage needs. By providing transparent insights into data points like reputation scores, users can choose the storage provider that best fits their needs and fosters the greatest sense of security and trust. You can take a sneak peek of DataStations’s platform on its [website](https://medium.com/buidl-labs/datastation-enhancing-the-experience-of-decentralised-storage-on-filecoin-79e8807b854d), as well as its full proposal on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/8d801d378e4dc7231792f958e7b077a8519452ad/open-grant-proposals/open-miner-marketplace.md).
