Over the past several months, the Filecoin community has been actively deliberating [FIP0056](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0056.md). This FIP is the second iteration of a proposed Sector Duration Multiplier (SDM), which would deliver additional block rewards to storage providers who elect to commit storage resources to the network for a longer period of time.

Proponents have argued that such a policy makes network incentives more sustainable and long-term oriented, while opponents have argued that such a policy would increase collateral requirements and destabilize existing business development efforts.

In order to reach consensus on this FIP, [Filecoin Core Devs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/core-devs/blob/master/Core%20Devs%20Participant%20List) were asked to contribute to a process of _hybrid soft consensus_. Filecoin Foundation facilitated this process, in which network stewards were convened to assess community preferences, network best practices, and the technical soundness of the proposal in order to determine consensus for accepting or rejecting the FIP.

Ultimately, Core Devsâ€™ consensus determined to reject the FIP. Although many Core Devs believed the FIP to be technically and economically sound, and that the proposed SDM model was incremental and appropriate, there was widespread concern that the broader Filecoin community did not agree.

For months, the storage provider community- who would be technically and financially responsible for implementing an SDM policy- had consistently communicated their dissatisfaction with this policy in joint statements, discussion threads, and public working group meetings. Ultimately, Core Devs broadly agreed that the governance threshold for soft consensus had not been met, and that no technicalities could justify accepting the FIP.

For more information, you can watch the deliberation conducted by Core Devs [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upUHn21ZIlQ). You can also review detailed meeting notes [HERE](https://github.com/filecoin-project/core-devs/blob/master/Core%20Dev%20Meetings/Meeting%200056.md).

Since FIP0056 has been rejected, it is not eligible for inclusion in any future network upgrades. In addition, the Filecoin Foundation will be working in the immediate term with Core Devs, storage providers, and the broader Filecoin community to improve governance practices to reflect lessons learned from the FIP0056 process.
