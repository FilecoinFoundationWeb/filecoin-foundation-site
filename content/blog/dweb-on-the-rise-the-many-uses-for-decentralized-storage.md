Organizations look to the decentralized web (dweb) for data storage because decentralization maximizes resiliency yet allows for choice. The early internet operated on a much more decentralized plane than today: Users could dial into an ISP of their choice, and switch as easily as changing a phone number. Websites could be run by any one of thousands of hosting providers around the world, instead of just being run by Amazon by default.

Returning to a version of the internet that more closely resembles that format will be a recipe for creating a better, more competitive and equitable internet. Decentralized storage - or destor – applies those decentralizing principles to the most precious commodity online: your data.

Here are just a few examples of industries and platforms utilizing decentralized storage via the Filecoin Network, working toward a better internet:

**Metaverse and Gaming**

As a leading decentralized data storage provider, Filecoin plays an important role as a building block of the metaverse and the future of gaming. With such a massive accumulation of data and digital assets, there must be a system in place to keep all of it safe and secure. Filecoin employs both Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Space Time (PoST) schemes to ensure that storage providers continue to store unique copies of user data. Below are a couple of companies using Filecoin in the metaverse and gaming worlds.

*Mona*

[Mona](https://monaverse.com/) is building a gallery in the metaverse for 3D art, with composable 3D spaces built by artists for artists. Recently, Mona launched the [Filecoin Forum](https://forum.mona.gallery/), which offers more than $200,000 in bounties for artists, architects and gamers to spur the creation of new 3D art spaces.

*OP Games*

[OP Games](https://www.opgames.org/) is giving the power back to game developers to build for the decentralized web. Today, most games are typically built using tools from big tech companies like  Amazon, Apple, and Google, which can limit capabilities and creativity. The OP community comprises players, game owners, and developers working together to shape the future of collectively owned games. Players can discover HTML5 games, compete in tournaments and buy OP NFTs.

[IPFS-FPS](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ipfs-fps-cd61j)IPFS-FPS is a completely decentralized game that lives on IPFS. Built on the Unity game engine, it pits players against robots and challenges players to collect Filecoin. Detailed instructions on game creation and deployment via Unity, Github, Fleek, Unstoppable Domain, and Pinata.cloud are provided in their [Medium article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/unity-on-ipfs-e0baa792f014), aimed at guiding game designers and developers to create similar experiences in less time.

**Video and Audio**

Needs for video and audio capabilities have outgrown the constraints of today’s web. This has necessitated a more decentralized architecture where creators have the ability to fully monetize their content and connect with the community, and a network with the bandwidth to support reliable connections anytime and anywhere. Huddle01 and Currents.fm are two of the companies using Filecoin to help make their video and audio communications more secure and reliable, while also creating an environment to collaborate.

*Huddle01*

[Huddle01](https://www.huddle01.com/) is bringing real-time video communications onto the decentralized web. The decentralized video conferencing platform offers a software development kit, custom domains and an in-depth analysis dashboard. Huddle01 is focused on improving the education sector, particularly in developing markets lacking access to strong internet infrastructure.

*Currents.fm*

[Currents.fm](https://a.currents.fm/) supports grassroots music development by creating a modern space for curators, creators and appreciators. The company’s founders believe that music is driven by the community and creativity cannot exist in a vacuum. With that in mind, Currents.fm encourages direct financial support and is building tools that foster meaningful connection, collaboration and engagement between creator and community.

**Science and Academia**

Decentralization plays a significant role in supporting the research of scientific worlds. Since the Human Genome Project, [billions of gigabytes of genomic data are collected every year](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/case-study-genrait-leverages-filecoin-network-for-greater-visibility-access-and-storage-of-1d56897a2d73). For researchers, Filecoin provides a network with enough bandwidth to store and analyze that data without the worry of overflow.

*Radix*

Radix is an operating system built for the lab, bringing futuristic technology to scientists to empower them to do their best work. Radix is building a next-generation visual programming language and optimizing compiler that takes biotech procedures and gathers them into instructions that can be executed in physical biology labs. Its goal is to accelerate biotech innovation by streamlining processes and bringing the hardware, software and people in the lab onto the same page.

*ATLAS experiment at CERN*

Last Fall, the ATLAS experiment at CERN partnered with Seal Storage Technology to explore decentralized cloud storage for data generated by the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. Seal Storage is a Filecoin storage provider, committing 10 PiBs of storage to ATLAS.

**Looking to the Future**

The examples above are just some of the many industries that are already using decentralized data storage today to build next generation tools. At Filecoin Foundation, we look forward to seeing how these organizations continue to shape the future of our world, all thanks to a secure storage system.
