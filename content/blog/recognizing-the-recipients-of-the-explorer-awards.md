Last year, we joined forces with [Unfinished](https://unfinished.com/) to launch the [Explorer Awards](https://explorerawards.org/), a series of grants to provide organizations and individuals using decentralized technology with the support to learn more about Web3. As a designer and developer of systems for a healthier digital society, Unfinished was an ideal partner for this initiative. The grants stem from a $200,000 funding pool that was dispersed in amounts between $1,000 and $10,000 to support projects that advanced learning and development in decentralized technology. The award was intended to fund anything from an NFT workshop to a metaverse exhibition to a Web3 dinner event.

The Web3 ecosystem is continuously growing, and Filecoin Foundation and Unfinished share the same mission to support decentralization to build a better, safer, and more equitable internet for the future. The only way that happens is by identifying and funding activists, developers, hackers, and passionate learners who strive to create an internet for the people, not one where the few control the desires of the many.

We’d like to highlight a few of the 2022 recipients of FF’s and Unfinished’s joint Explorer Awards, below:

**Crystal Hendricks-Kretzer**

Crystal Hendricks-Kretzer is a Grant Officer at Cyber Collective and runs her own agency called Crystal Rae Creative. Prior to joining Cyber Collective, she served as Director of Marketing and Communications at Taproot Foundation.

Both Filecoin Foundation and Unfinished know that decentralized technology can enable a better future where users have more control over their data, so we’re proud to distribute these grants to such a diverse and well-deserved group who are genuinely curious about Web3 and the ways decentralized technologies can be used for good. The hope is that this joint initiative will introduce more people from different backgrounds to the space and provide the educational resources they need. We can’t wait to hear about the results from this push for exploration and the impact these grants have on the long-term goal of building a better internet.
