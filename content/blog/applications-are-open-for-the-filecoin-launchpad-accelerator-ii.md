[Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator](https://mesh.xyz/tachyon/), powered by [Tachyon](https://mesh.xyz/tachyon/), is seeking applications for its next cohort of innovators. The program is designed to support projects that build on and bridge the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) communities with tools, middleware, and apps.

If you have an idea for a tool or service that leverages these platforms, [**apply today**](https://tachyon.submittable.com/submit/192229/filecoin-launchpad-accelerator-ii) to be a part of this outstanding program. **Applications are open through midnight EST on May 9, 2021.**

The Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator is a full-time, fully-remote program designed to help startups build more open, interoperable, and programmable tools, infrastructure, and applications for the distributed and decentralized web. Over 12 weeks this summer, 20 teams around the world will receive access to more than $80,000 USD in total funding, along with mentorship, benefits and programming to support their growth. What’s more — teams will have the opportunity to leverage access to the [ConsenSys](https://mesh.xyz/) and [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) networks, technical know-how, and expertise. The program culminates in a Demo Day in September.

Tachyon, one of the organizing forces behind the program, is a leading accelerator for early-stage blockchain and Web 3.0 startups. Launchpad is designed to be an intense sprint to help teams hone their value proposition, test their assumptions and prepare for the next phase of their growth.

The Filecoin Foundation, which facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds critical development projects, and supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem, is here to support and foster these teams, too, through community events, dev grant applications and promotion.

The first round of the Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator included 13 teams and 32 founders from 11 countries. Projects included [WrappedFil](https://wfil.network/), the first Filecoin wrapped token on Ethereum; [Parcel](https://parcel.money/), a self-custodial treasury management system with end-to-end data encryption; and [Voodfy](https://voodfy.com/), a private, decentralized video hosting platform, among many others. Watch the [Demo Day presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV19AJ9uqZODM16cL8oj3uAO-)from this first cohort to see what can be accomplished with the support of this program.
