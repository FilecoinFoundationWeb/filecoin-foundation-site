We’re excited to announce the launch of the [Orbit Community Program](https://orbitcommunity.filecoin.io/), powered by [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) and [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/). This program will foster a global community of advocates dedicated to advancing the larger Web3 ecosystem by amplifying the voice of Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p (both online and offline!), organizing meetups and events, and creating unique content and educational resources.

Today, we’re kicking off the search for the _very first_ cohort of Cadets, and applications are open! If you’re passionate about decentralized storage, [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), and the mission to preserve humanity’s most important information, we want you to [apply](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/Dv6FWzlr)!

Cadets who are selected will have the opportunity to work alongside Filecoin Foundation and Protocol Labs to spread the word about next-generation solutions that are building the foundation of the decentralized web. It’s also an opportunity to become a more active participant in the community and get to know other Orbit Community members.

If you are a part of an organization that is interested in supporting the community, you can [apply](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/XgSjcHyz) to join the Spaceship track! This track will open up opportunities for organizations to showcase new use cases for Filecoin, IPFS, Libp2p, to speak at and sponsor conferences at a high level, introduce new collaborators into the ecosystem, and so much more.

**Community is vital to the development of Web3.**

The Filecoin project is completely open-source, inviting people all over the world to participate. Since Mainnet launch in October 2020, the network has witnessed explosive growth. Today, the Filecoin Network has over 15EiB of storage power, more than 3,800 active storage providers, and nearly 300 apps. The goal of the Orbit Community Program is to facilitate, fast track, and inspire the continued growth of the Filecoin community and ecosystem.

As the community continues to expand and evolve, we want to give people of all backgrounds an equal opportunity to learn more about the impact of Web3 technologies. With that in mind, community leaders are those who are active in the current Filecoin community, firmly grounded in the technical development of Web3 applications, and passionate about community, education, and bringing more people into the space. The Orbit Community Program will reward contributors based on a four-tier milestone system that will range from swag kits and access to the Filecoin Slack to exclusive event invitations and engagement opportunities. More details will be shared soon.

With a team of dedicated advocates, we can elevate the borderless potential of Web3 technology across global barriers. If you are passionate about our work and want to help power decentralized applications on Web3, **apply to become a** [**Cadet**](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/Dv6FWzlr) **or** [**Spaceship**](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/XgSjcHyz) **today!**
