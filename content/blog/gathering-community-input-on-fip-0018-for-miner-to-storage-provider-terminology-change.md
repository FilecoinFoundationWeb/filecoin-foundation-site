The Filecoin community is currently considering Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP) 0018, which proposes to rebrand network “miners” as “storage providers”.

The change was initiated by miners themselves, who argue that the term “storage provider” is a better representation of the role they play in the network. The current [FIP-0018 Draft Proposal](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0018.md) lists this and other perspectives as the primary motivator for the revision.

Many members of the Filecoin community have already weighed in on this issue. This includes miners as well as developers, ambassadors, and others who participate in the Filecoin ecosystem in unique ways. Although the response to FIP-0018 has been overwhelmingly positive, the language adjustment will not be formally adopted until the entire Filecoin community has had an opportunity to provide feedback.

FIP-0018 will remain in “Last Call” status until Friday, August 20 in order to provide ample time for input gathering. Those who wish to share their thoughts on this FIP are invited to do so until this date, at which point the community will officially move to accept or reject the proposal.

If you would like to learn more about this FIP, deliberate the proposed change, or in any other way share your perspective, we encourage you to do so via the Filecoin [Slack](http://filecoinproject.slack.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/filecoin-project) channels. The Filecoin community and Filecoin governance protocols are open to everyone, including those who may be new to Web3 or have not previously contributed to the network.

In view of FIP-0018 and other FIPs advancing in the coming months, the Filecoin Foundation will audit existing governance policies to ensure that Filecoin governance remains a robust, open, and accessible process as the network continues to grow and evolve.
