The Filecoin Foundation and Protocol Labs periodically award funding to critical development projects to foster a more robust and efficient decentralized web through the Filecoin ecosystem.

Dev Grants are a way to reward those who are adding value to the Filecoin ecosystem, encourage new builders to get involved and seed new products and businesses that increase the utility of Filecoin.

Filecoin Dev Grants are now awarded on a monthly basis. **Wave 9 proposals are due Friday, July 30, by 11:59 PM PDT for priority consideration. Submit your proposal** [**here**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#-how-to-apply)**.**

Here’s a summary of the ten projects that received funding in July as part of the Wave 8 Dev Grant cycle:

[Glitter RSS Reader Desktop](https://github.com/tedl-1990/devgrants/blob/glitter-desktop/open-grant-proposals/glitter-desktop.md)  
Glitter is a socialized RSS reader based on IPFS and Filecoin; it also provides a digital wallet function. Users can post articles, microblogs, images, videos, and other content on various topics. They can also subscribe to Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms through Glitter without complicated switches. Content on Glitter is provided on IPFS and uploaded to the Filecoin network, giving users a more secure and persistent service.

[Opscientia: Data Hosting Research](https://github.com/XandraMcC/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-opscientia.md)  
This is an Open Science (Opsci) Data Wallet project to make it easier for neuroscientists to securely share data with their peers. The project includes reward structures both for neuroscientists to share their data, and to citizens for taking part in neuroscience studies. The project also allows citizens to retain ownership over their data and easily modify permissions (including with third parties, if they wish).

[vArtisans](https://github.com/aldenpang/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-vartisans.md)  
This is a VR platform designed for Oculus Quest that allows artists in the 3D space to upload their articles to Filecoin for encrypted identification. A VR application able to run Oculus Quest 1 and 2 will allow artists to paint, sculpt, and draw in a VR space with many brushes, colors and patterns, and then store articles on Filecoin.

[Bidirectional FIL Bridge](https://github.com/wbnns/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-wrapped-filecoin.md)  
This is a trustless open-source and bidirectional bridge from FIL to WFIL to enable users to easily move back and forth. This allows long-term holders of FIL a way to take advantage of many of the opportunities that exist in DeFi, particularly on Ethereum and L2s like Polygon.

[Decoupling WinningPoSt and WindowPoSt from lotus-miner](https://github.com/siriusmz/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-Improve-stability-of-miner.md)  
The project is intended to improve the stability of storage providers in WindowPoSt and mining blocks. Developed based on the current lotus source code, the idea is to take lotus-worker rather than lotus-miner as the entrance while storing cached or sealed sector files. Among the benefits is for storage capacity to be expanded via lotus-worker directly.

[yaytso](https://github.com/aklevecz/devgrants/blob/patch-1/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-template.md)  
yaytsos are user-generated NFT eggs. Each yaytso is patterned by an uploaded image and/or mouse/touch doodle. Once users are pleased with their egg-piece, they are guided through the process of generating the metadata for the name and description. All relevant data and assets are packaged and pinned to IPFS, with content address data saved on-chain as a way to enforce uniqueness.

[Machine Learning NFT Data Labeling](https://github.com/TuninsightBlockchain/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-Machine%20Learning%20labled%20Dataset%20NFT%20storage%20and%20sharing%20via%20IPFS_Filecoin.md)  
Data labeling or annotation is the process of adding metadata to a dataset. This project helps add comprehensive and consistent tags when developing training datasets for machine learning. The solution can forge a dataset to NFT and save to the Filecoin network to make the dataset unique and permission based, with profit shared by the original author.

[XDV Protocol](https://github.com/molekilla/devgrants/blob/patch-3/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-xdv.md)  
XDV Protocol is a project focusing on making any document, metadata, linked data or linked token verifiable within decentralized blockchain stores like Filecoin, decentralized content networks like IPFS or hybrid decentralized content networks with blockchain features like Swarm Bee.

[IPFS Search](https://github.com/ipfs-search/devgrants/blob/rfp-ipfs-search-scale-out/open-grant-proposals/ipfs-search-scale-out.md)  
This grant will take IPFS-search from beta to web-scale production with an engine powerful enough to integrate with meta-search engines like DuckDuckGo and SearX, as well as browsers like Brave and Opera. In order to support an API capable of handling 1,000 hits per second, this grant will help increase the scalability of the engine — both the size of the index as well as the number of queries it can handle.

[NFT Gallery](https://github.com/froid1911/devgrants/blob/master/open-grant-proposals/open-proposal-nft-gallery.md)  
This initiative aims to make it easier to organize NFTs in galleries and display them wherever needed in a self-sovereign way. In order to reach this goal, developers will adopt the identity protocol for open applications idx.xyz, which relies on the general open information protocol ceramic.network. The user will be able to use a social login to enter the app, sort NFTs in galleries and later display them on any screen with an internet connection.

We hope these projects will inspire you to build new tools and applications on the Filecoin network.
