_This is one in a series of periodic blog posts devoted to profiling Filecoin storage providers. In these posts, we examine what they bring to — and the benefits they derive from — the Filecoin ecosystem._

NonEntropy is on a mission to protect the digital future. Today,[ more than 50 zettabytes of data](https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-data-explained-how-much-were-producing-and-where-its-all-stored-159964) are stored globally. However, NonEntropy believes there is an oligopoly forming among the world’s largest cloud service providers and that this centralization poses a threat to business’ continuity and data privacy.

[NonEntropy Japan, Inc](https://nonentropy.jp/). was founded in 2020 by Mitsunori Yasuda, with the goal of preparing businesses for Web3 by equipping them with tools to navigate the geopolitical risks of data, reduce the risk of information tampering and leakage, and strengthen data integrity. By leveraging IPFS and Filecoin, NonEntropy says it can help fortify the infrastructure on which the decentralized web is built.

Even before the global pandemic, the team at NonEntropy understood that rapid adoption of remote-first services and widespread reliance on digital tools was imminent. Meanwhile, the company was sensitive to the fact that the world’s information was becoming more centralized and reliant on large, centralized cloud storage providers like Google Cloud and AWS.

“While everything has become extremely convenient for consumers thanks to innovation by companies like Amazon, Facebook, or Apple, that convenience brings about a lot of issues. The companies that bring us different advantages, they also control all of our data. That’s why we have to build a decentralized web,” said NonEntropy CEO, Takuo Nishimura.

NonEntropy’s business model focuses on keeping the “data highway” clear of obstruction so that the world can travel freely with their data. For the last three and a half years, NonEntropy has been working on information collaboration with Protocol Labs. Today, NonEntropy manages and operates the world’s largest Filecoin storage equipment in Asia. The company has more than 160 PiB of storage across its businesses and recently added 10 PiB in a one-month period. This aggressive growth is largely attributed to the promising opportunity of decentralized web services.

Additionally, the company’s [IPFS Gateway](https://nonentropy.jp/about-services/#ipfs-gateway) and [Nonepool](https://nonentropy.jp/about-services/#nonepool) services utilize the Filecoin Network to provide a combination of data storage and data management consulting to its customers, mainly companies, museums, schools, and local governments interested in managing and protecting large amounts of data.

NonEntropy works with many large brands around the world. It is the official development partner of American company [Matterport](https://matterport.com/), a 3D data platform used to securely store and manage 3D digital twins of properties, which plans to scan buildings or cities around the world and save 3D data into Filecoin storage. Most recently it scanned a large Tokyo nightclub and saved it to the Filecoin network.

“It is very exciting that we can contribute to building a new generation of storage through decentralized web solutions using Filecoin,” said NonEntropy Chief Strategy Officer Noritaka Kobayashi.

NonEntropy is helping to grow the Filecoin ecosystem by building out capabilities and infrastructure that prepare businesses for the Web3 environment and avoid Web 2.0 pitfalls such as unauthorized access, information leakage, and risk of data falsification. Using Filecoin, NonEntropy is building a world where information and value can be freely exchanged.
