The Filecoin community has completed its first-ever [FILPoll](https://filpoll.io/), a new tool for surveying stakeholders on improvement proposals and other initiatives. Thanks to the 200+ storage miners who participated in the poll for [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md), which considered whether to allow miners to extend v1 proof sectors up to a maximum lifetime of 540 days. Extending such sectors was disabled in the network version v7 upgrade (November 2020) due to a security concern with these proofs; v1.1 proofs were introduced to fix this security concern. This caused problems for miners who sealed v1 proof sectors in the early days of the network. Read more about the [Filecoin Improvement Proposal process](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0001.md) and this first FIL-Poll [here](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/participate-in-the-filecoin-networks-poll-on-extending-the-maximum-lifetime-of-v1-sectors-6bd730fb2032).

**Survey Result**

The poll officially closed at 16:00 UTC, Saturday, March 27th. Miners voted overwhelmingly to allow extending the v1 proof sector’s lifetime to up to 540 days. The full results of the survey can be found [here](https://ipfs.io/ipns/bafzbeienruqphecp2wmz3sen472jbhgchia6j3vjoykbxjhzfnkdsr4owm).

Together, participating miners represented more than 1.22 EiB of total network storage power, which is more than a third of the network’s overall storage capacity. 97.74% of the voted power was in favor of accepting FIP-0014, while 2.26% of voted power rejected the proposal. Out of 1650 active miners, 150 miners voted to accept FIP-0014, 53 miners rejected the proposal, and 1 miner abstained.

**What’s Next**

The Filecoin [core devs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/tpm) will now make a final decision on whether the FIP should be accepted in the network based on the poll result and a final security audit. Final decisions will be posted on this blog and in the [FIP-0014 discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/issues/56) later today.

Thanks to everyone who participated in this first FIPs survey on FIP-0014. Your continued involvement and contributions are critical to the success of the network! FILPolls are one of the many small steps required to create transparent and fully-functioning community governance.
