It’s been one year since the Filecoin Mainnet launch, and there’s a lot planned to celebrate this first year in orbit! Join the Filecoin Foundation as we host a series of events the week of October 18 to mark Filecoin Mainnet’s one-year milestone.

**On Monday, October 18, we’re hosting a virtual** [**Web3 Recruiting Happy Hour.**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/web3-recruiting-happy-hour-tickets-180240844217) Join us to learn more about open roles at the Filecoin Foundation and with our community grantees. We’ll have reps on hand from the Filecoin Foundation as well as from Guardian Project, Internet Archive, The Starling Lab, and others to talk about their projects and their hiring needs. Join us in [Gathertown](https://www.gather.town/) from 5–6 PM ET to learn more about these opportunities. \[The first 10 people who show up at the event will receive a swag bag filled with goodies from our grantees.\] [**RSVP**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/web3-recruiting-happy-hour-tickets-180240844217)**.**

**On Tuesday, October 19, join us for a one-hour, virtual** [**Filecoin Governance Town Hall**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/filecoin-governance-town-hall-tickets-182696428937)**.** In this Zoom workshop, we’ll discuss the idea of web3 governance and dive deeper into how it relates to the Filecoin ecosystem. We’ll also walk through the development of governance in mature crypto ecosystems, chat about opportunities for on- and off-chain governance in web3, and gather participant feedback on their experiences with community decision-making. This event will serve as a precursor to the Filecoin ecosystem’s internal stakeholder governance meetings planned for November 10–12. [**RSVP**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/filecoin-governance-town-hall-tickets-182696428937)**.**

**And finally, on Wednesday, October 20, we’re hosting the** [**Filecoin Orbit Lounge**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/filecoin-orbit-lounge-at-dc-fintech-week-tickets-182039955407) **in Washington, D.C., as part of** [**DC Fintech Week 2021**.](https://www.dcfintechweek.org/) While the main event is virtual this year, we’re excited to host the official in-person “watch party” component at our Filecoin Orbit Lounge, from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM at Yours Truly DC, 1143 New Hampshire Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC 20037.

Stop by to watch DC Fintech Week programming and network with fellow attendees. Hosted by Georgetown University Law Center, DC Fintech Week convenes nonprofits, technologists, entrepreneurs, and regulators to discuss emerging policy issues around financial innovation.

Beginning at 2:30 PM, we’ll host in-person programming to celebrate Filecoin Orbit and explore the possibilities of the token economy. [**RSVP**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/filecoin-orbit-lounge-at-dc-fintech-week-tickets-182039955407)**.** (Please note, to ensure the safety of our guests, capacity is limited to 50 people at a time).

It’s been a phenomenal orbit around the sun for the Filecoin ecosystem, and we can’t wait to see what’s in store for this outstanding project in the next 12 months. Thanks for celebrating with us.
