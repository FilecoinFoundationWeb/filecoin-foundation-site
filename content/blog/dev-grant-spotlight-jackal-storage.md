_This is the latest post in our series highlighting the builders and innovators creating new tools and services on the Filecoin network._ [_Learn more_](https://grants.filecoin.io/) _about the Filecoin Foundation’s Dev Grants program, and_ [_read up_](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-wave-9-developer-grant-recipients-d3f92868ba1f) _on Wave 9 recipients._

[JACKAL Storage](https://jackaldao.com/) is a platform that provides a secure, private, and user-friendly solution for decentralized storage on the Filecoin network. JACKAL Storage helps to lower barriers to decentralized file storage by acting as a top layer to organize user data between the decentralized storage network and its users. Its goal is to create an incentivized, peer-to-peer caching layer between the[ Secret Network](https://scrt.network/), a blockchain with data privacy by default, and the Filecoin network.

In late 2021, JACKAL, the team behind JACKAL Storage, was awarded a developer grant to bring speed, utility, and privacy by default to fully decentralized cloud storage. Through this approach, the team is aiming to provide a user and developer-friendly environment.

JACKAL possesses a unique opportunity to make data verifiable on a blockchain while being fully private, encrypted, and secure. In fact, the JACKAL team expects that hosting data on JACKAL Storage, leveraging the Filecoin network, will be over 80% cheaper than hosting on standard industry cloud storage provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

The fully decentralized nature of JACKAL sets them apart from other blockchain storage tools. The team believes data privacy is a fundamental human right and has built a storage platform that’s true to decentralization while increasing users’ digital privacy and providing the highest cybersecurity posture possible.

While some decentralized storage providers require users to create an account with an email address to store and access files, JACKAL advocates for users owning their data and having complete control over its use and existence. As a result, data hosted on JACKAL Storage can only be accessed and shared by the end-user via their private key through the[ Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/). Files on JACKAL can only be encrypted or decrypted by the end-user with their private key. In other words, users have full control of their data and it’s only accessible with a private key.

Developers will also be able to build Web3 applications on top of JACKAL’s hot-storage platform with permissions and viewing variables. This will enable the development of applications and access markets that are not leveraging decentralized file storage yet. Proposed apps have already been submitted to JACKAL for consideration, including a password management service, website hosting, and a Secret NFT storage solution.

The Filecoin Developer Grant will specifically help power JACKAL’s team to launch JACKAL Storage in March of this year. The grant will be used in the span of 14 weeks supporting the team until the minimum viable product launches on the Mainnet. Shortly after launch, JACKAL will host a private sale and launch the utility token for node incentivization to drive the expansion of Filecoin’s peer-to-peer storage network, motivating new storage providers to sign up. The grant will help build momentum until JACKAL Storage becomes fully operational.

JACKAL will also conduct a Testnet alpha of JACKAL Storage between February 14 and March 4. Individuals interested in incentivized testing can sign up[ HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdda_X6rnHPIUe8DbsJnC1ppIoayglBud-3-ek8ELSqtv71vg/viewform).

Through all this process, JACKAL is bringing together the Filecoin Network and the Secret Network, with the goal of increasing usage and user acquisition, providing a product that both enterprise clients and individuals need.
