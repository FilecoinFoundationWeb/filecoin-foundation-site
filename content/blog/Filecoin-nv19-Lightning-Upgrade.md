Filecoin nv19 Lightning Upgrade

On April 27, 2023, the Filecoin network launched the highly-anticipated nv19 Lightning Upgrade, marking a significant leap forward in the realm of decentralized storage. This technical milestone brings a host of enhancements and improvements to the Filecoin ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency, security, and usability.

The Lightning upgrade includes technical enhancements and bug fixes that will help to reduce block synchronization times, a new challenge that has emerged as the number of storage deals occurring on the network has grown. FIP0060 solves this problem by increasing the market deal maintenance interval to 30 days. Doing so reduces the frequency of network-wide deal maintenance, a safe and efficient design choice that will reduce the amount of network power being consumed by maintenance activities. This improvement will enhance overall network performance, enabling a seamless and efficient decentralized storage experience.

The Lightning upgrade also introduces FIP0061, a community proposal that improves the security and robustness of the Filecoin proof system. With the introduction of a new challenge generation algorithm, it will be easier to prove and verify WindowPoSt more effectively. By optimizing WindowPoSt proofs, the upgrade enhances the network's resistance to potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of stored data.

FIP0061 is implemented in two phases, with the first phase being part of the Lightning Upgrade and the final phase included in the recent nv20 Thunder Upgrade. For nv20, no new FIPs were introduced and there was no need for Storage Providers or Data Clients to update any network software.

Lastly, FIP0062 introduces a fallback method handler for multisig and payment channel actors, empowering them with increased flexibility and usability, this improves interoperability with smart contracts and Ethereum accounts. This enhancement opens up avenues for advanced smart contract functionalities and facilitates seamless transactions and interactions within the network.

The successful launch of the Lightning Upgrade represents the collective efforts of the Filecoin community, from ideation to implementation. Developers, storage providers, and community engineers have collaborated tirelessly, refining the Filecoin protocol, conducting rigorous testing, and gathering valuable feedback. The complexity of this undertaking necessitated meticulous planning, coordination, and constant communication among various stakeholders within the Filecoin ecosystem.

The nv19 Lightning Upgrade represents a remarkable achievement, made possible by the dedication and innovative spirit of the entire Filecoin community and implementation teams. This milestone sets the tone for the future of the network, pushing the boundaries of decentralized storage and reaffirming Filecoin's position at the forefront of the industry.

Looking ahead, governance and community engagement remain critical components of designing, driving and instantiating robust governing systems, tools, and methodologies. Filecoin Foundation through the governance team has put together monthly Community Governance Calls.
