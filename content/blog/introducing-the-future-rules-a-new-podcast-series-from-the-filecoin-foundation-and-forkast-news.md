Today, we’re thrilled to announce the launch of “[The Future Rules](https://the-future-rules-forkast-news-x-filecoin-foundation.simplecast.com/),” a new podcast series dedicated to exploring the intersection of Web3 and the many factors that impact the growth and viability of a decentralized web.

Co-hosted by Filecoin Foundation Board Chair Marta Belcher and veteran journalist Angie Lau, editor-in-chief of [_Forkast News_](https://forkast.news/), “The Future Rules” takes on a range of issues — from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), to mining, digital privacy, and beyond — in order to chart the ever-expanding Web3 landscape and its implications.

Our [debut episode](https://the-future-rules-forkast-news-x-filecoin-foundation.simplecast.com/episodes/decentralized-finance) takes on decentralized finance (DeFi) with guest Sheila Warren, head of Data, Blockchain and Digital Assets at the World Economic Forum, where she also serves as a member of the Executive Committee. Sheila kicks off by explaining what DeFi is, and then takes a look at the potential it offers for financial inclusion before delving into the rumblings of a showdown between decentralized finance and regulators. She also explains how the WEF’s [Policy-Maker Toolkit](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_DeFi_Policy_Maker_Toolkit_2021.pdf) can help policymakers negotiate that tightrope and why we are all better off if “premature regulation” is avoided.
