**OCTOBER 17, 2022** — [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) — an independent organization that facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds critical development projects, supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem, and advocates for Filecoin and the decentralized web — unveils the details of [FIL Lisbon](https://fil-lisbon.io/), the first major gathering of the Filecoin community in Lisbon, Portugal, taking place October 30 — November 4.

“The Filecoin ecosystem has seen tremendous growth this year. The amount of client data onboarded to the network has increased 9x to over 230 PiB in 2022 and is growing \~25% month over month. Clients storing data to Filecoin include traditional Web2 institutions with large datasets and growing Web3 applications, such as web3.storage, which now stores 140M uploads from 80K+ users,” said Colin Evran, Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs. “FIL Lisbon provides this engaged and growing community an opportunity to connect, learn, and share ideas on how to bring more startups and use cases to the world’s largest decentralized network. We look forward to seeing everyone there.”

* **October 30** — The Filecoin Interplanetary Party: Kick off FIL Lisbon with the Filecoin community and celebrate two years since Filecoin mainnet launch.
* **October 31 — November 1** — Main Stage Days: The two-day Main Stage programming will include insightful talks from top-notch speakers and panel discussions from the world’s foremost Filecoin ecosystem participants. Additionally, we’re hosting interactive workshops with Web3 builders, who will take attendees through the Filecoin roadmap, world of Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), NFTs, sustainability, updates from the storage provider ecosystem, the metaverse, and beyond.

Additionally, from October 24 — November 4, Filecoin Foundation is hosting a [hacker base](https://hackerbase.eventbrite.com/) with Fission Codes and Lightshift. It will be a place for co-working, workshops, and lightning talks throughout the week.
