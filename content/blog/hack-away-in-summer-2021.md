This summer, the Filecoin Foundation is supporting numerous hackathons for community members. Hackathons let developers and other creatives collaborate on a project over a set period of time with the goal of producing a functioning software by the end of the event. When community members participate in hackathons using Filecoin, they add valuable new tools and programs to the Filecoin ecosystem. Not to mention, the most innovative creators have the chance to win big prizes!

Below are the details on hackathons you can participate in this summer, plus some bonus events to put on your calendar.

**Filecoin Grant Global Online Hackathon**

Check out these winners of past hackathons that the Filecoin Foundation has supported. Last summer’s [Spark University Hackathon](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/spark-university-hackathon-winners-challenge-one/) winner, [DeepVerse](https://deepverse.co.uk/), enabled researchers to make the machine-learning models they’ve developed publicly available, using the Filecoin network to store and distribute them. A location-based NFT AR game called [CryptoLlama](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/cryptollama) was named the best tool for easing storage and retrieval of data with Filecoin at the [Chainlink Spring 2021 Hackathon](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-05-03-chainlink-recap/). Most recently, [NiftySubs](https://niftysubs.com/), a decentralized video streaming platform where users can watch premium content from their favorite creators, won the Protocol Labs prize at [HackMoney 2021](https://defi.ethglobal.co/).
