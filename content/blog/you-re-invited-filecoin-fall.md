As we enjoy the last days of summer, we’re already planning for our next set of upcoming events: Filecoin Fall. No matter where you are, or how you’re involved in the Filecoin community, there’s something for everyone in the ecosystem over the next few months. Here’s a list of what’s ahead:

**First stop: Global Blockchain Business Council UNGA (Sept. 20)**

Filecoin Foundation is heading to New York City to sponsor the [Global Blockchain Business Council’s UNGA](https://gbbcouncil.org/event/blockchain-central-unga-2022/) in September. The event will draw thought leaders and the people driving change across blockchain, business, government, and technology for discussions on how blockchain-powered solutions can enable progress toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

**Next up: Unfinished Live (Sept. 21–24)**

While you’re in the Big Apple, stop by [Unfinished Live 2022](https://live.unfinished.com/), a hybrid event that focuses on “the impact of technology on our civic lives.” Filecoin Foundation President and Chair Marta Belcher will join Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), to discuss cryptocurrency and blockchain, and how these technologies can empower individuals and protect civil liberties. Also at Unfinished, Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) will host spirited roundtable discussions with speakers from the main stage in the FFDW lounge. The lounge will also host networking and social impact sessions throughout the week.

**Community Gathering: FIL-Singapore ’22 Summit (Sept. 26–27)**

With a theme of “Empowering a Web3 world,” [FIL-Singapore](https://fil-singapore.io/) will feature educational tracks on building a Web3 ecosystem, visionary discussions of the impact of decentralized storage and an overview of new developments in the metaverse.

Hosted by the IPFS Force, with support from [Filecoin Foundation](http://fil.org/), [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) and many more, this collaborative event will feature more than 100 speakers and over 20 panels. If you’re planning to attend [Token2049](https://www.token2049.com/) (Sept. 28–29), make sure to join the Filecoin Community for progress updates on the Filecoin Roadmap, the latest on Filecoin Virtual Machine, Filecoin cryptoeconomics, and more.

**Explore Greener Solutions: Sustainable Blockchain Summit LATAM (Oct. 12)**

Organized by the Filecoin Green team, the [Sustainable Blockchain Summit LATAM](https://sbs.tech/) seeks to catalyze projects that will better align the global economy with the natural world, and broaden the scope of our ambitions to encompass all planetary boundaries required to keep our world habitable. Join the world’s premiere forum at the intersection of Web3 and the biosphere, and help us solve these problems together.

**Let’s Cheers to 2 Years: Filecoin Mainnet Launch Anniversary**

Filecoin Foundation will mark the second anniversary of the Filecoin mainnet launch in October! It’s incredible how the ecosystem has grown in just two years with over 18 EiB of network storage capacity, 4,000+ storage providers, and 425+ organizations building on the network. We will take a moment to mark the occasion with a number of surprises at Fil-Lisbon.

**Final stop: FIL-Lisbon (Oct. 30-Nov. 4)**

We’re rounding out Filecoin Fall with [FIL-Lisbon](https://hub.fil.org/fil-lisbon) at the [LX Factory](https://www.google.com/maps/place/LxFactory/@38.7034979,-9.178873,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x33ebaaaa14f543ac!8m2!3d38.7034979!4d-9.178873) in Lisbon, Portugal. The event will bring together the builders, developers and contributors building the Filecoin ecosystem. Hosted by Filecoin Foundation, the event will feature two days of mainstage programming and a week’s worth of workshops, panels, networking, and hands-on experiences for our European community, including our Hacker House.

Come join us to learn how the Filecoin network is expanding and how you can help grow the Web3 ecosystem. Save the date for Oct. 30-Nov. 4 in Lisbon!
