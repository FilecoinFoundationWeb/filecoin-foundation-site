Filecoin Foundation (FF) and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) are now accepting grant proposals for projects that increase utility for Filecoin and Zcash projects. Together, we’re working to empower the Filecoin, Zcash, and greater Web3 ecosystems through a new grants pool that funds Filecoin and Zcash projects.

Proposals can be submitted through [Github](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/zcash-and-filecoin.md#zcash-and-filecoin-rfp). Any proposal that leads to additional utility for both FIL and ZEC chains and their respective ecosystems would be considered, and innovation is encouraged. More information about the program, including grant requirement details, can be found on our website: [ff-ecc-grants.org](https://ff-ecc-grants.org/).

FF and ECC are considering any proposals that expand the utility of Filecoin and Zcash as well as their respective ecosystems. The [new website](http://ff-ecc-grants.org/) details examples of projects that are ideal for the grant program, such as projects that support Filecoin storage payments in ZEC, media and file support in Zcash encrypted memos and NFTs, and zero-knowledge technology.

Applications and requirements for submission are being accepted on a rolling basis through December 31st, 2023. Grants will be funded by a pool of more than 300,000 FIL, provided by the Filecoin Foundation. Additional funds may be added by ECC and FF.

As part of this latest round of grant funding, FF and ECC announced that the Halo 2 codebase is also now shared via the MIT license — simpler and more permissive than its previous open-source license — in addition to the launch of the RFP-style grants program. All work funded through this RFP must be open-sourced via MIT and Apache2 licenses.

Halo 2 is a zero-knowledge proving system invented at ECC which eliminates the need for a [trusted setup](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-parameters). . With its new permissive licensing, Halo 2 is increasing accessibility and collaboration within the Zcash, Filecoin, and broader Web3 communities.

This latest announcement between FF and ECC follows an announcement last September that Filecoin Foundation and ECC, along with Protocol Labs and the Ethereum Foundation, were launching a [multi-faceted collaboration](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/)focused on Halo 2, the first trustless and recursive zero-knowledge-proof cryptography, discovered by ECC’s Sean Bowe.
