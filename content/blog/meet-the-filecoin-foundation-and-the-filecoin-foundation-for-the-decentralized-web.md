The boards and advisors of the Filecoin Foundation (FF) and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) took the stage at Filecoin Liftoff Week to talk about the future of the organizations and the promise of Web3.

Below is an overview of FF and FFDW board members and advisors along with highlights from that discussion:

**Marta Belcher  
Chair of the Board, FF and FFDW  
**A pioneer in blockchain law and policy, Marta has provided legal representation to numerous crypto projects, exchanges, industry associations, and civil liberties groups. She currently serves as special counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and as outside general counsel for Protocol Labs, and works as a lawyer specializing in blockchain and emerging technologies for Ropes & Gray LLP.

_“The decentralized web can help us preserve humanity’s most important data. The centralized nature of today’s internet means that users have no choice but to trust intermediaries with their data. And the fact that file storage is essentially a monopoly means that there is a single point of failure for much of today’s internet. Decentralizing the web can empower users, enhance security, and ensure that data can be stored reliably over time. I am so excited to be part of these Foundations to accelerate the growth of this important technology and to support the Filecoin and decentralized web communities.”_

**Rainey Reitman  
Board of Directors, FFDW  
**Rainey has dedicated her career to creating informed and powerful movements of technology users who can organize to defend free expression, preserve privacy, and oppose government overreach. She is currently the Chief Program Officer of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and is a co-founder and board member for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Previously, she was a co-founder and steering committee member for the Chelsea Manning Support Network and served as Communications Director for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.

_“Every day, I see how the centralized web fails ordinary technology users. An internet that has been built for profit at the cost of consumer choice and privacy isn’t what people need. We have to create a digital ecosystem that can’t be controlled by a few tech monopolies. The Filecoin Foundation will be a crucial link in that ecosystem.”_

**Brian Behlendorf  
Board of Directors, FF and FFDW  
**Brian is General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. In this capacity, Brian leads both the Hyperledger open-source enterprise blockchain software initiative, as well as Linux Foundation Public Health, which builds software and services that assist public health authorities in the fight against the pandemic. Brian has a long history with open source software, going back to co-founding the Apache web server project in 1995, and from that point forward founding or working for a series of companies (Wired Magazine, Organic, CollabNet), non-profits (like the World Economic Forum), and governments (Office of Science and Tech Policy 2009, advisor to HHS ONC 2010). Brian also serves on the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

_“There’s a temptation to think that the future of the web will be all about software, protocols, and algorithms. But the internet wasn’t built by software; it was built by people. To advance the next generation of the web, we need to bring people together into a trusted community.”_

**Marcia Hofmann  
Board of Directors, FF; Advisor, FFDW  
**Marcia is an attorney who litigates, counsels, writes, and speaks about a broad range of technology law and policy issues. She currently works in-house at a technology company. Before that, she founded Zeitgeist Law PC, a boutique law practice focused on computer crime and security, electronic privacy, free expression, and intellectual property. She has served as a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Electronic Privacy Information Center. She was also a non-residential fellow at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society and taught as an adjunct professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and Colorado Law.

_“The promise of the decentralized web is to shift decision-making power from the few to the many. If successful, this change will not only make it possible for ordinary people to have more control over the technologies they use, but also spur competition among innovators to build different and better options. We aim to ensure this promise becomes a reality.”_

_“Decentralized storage offers hope for long term digital preservation and access — in this way many archives and memory institutions can help back each other up. The Filecoin Foundation and IPFS community understand the importance of digital stewardship and are concretely helping support these efforts.”_

_“It’s beginning to become axiomatic that any innovative tech stack has a blockchain layer. But we’re still far away from the ubiquity of blockchain technology that will enable the decentralized web to really take off. To get to where we need to be, it’ll take a global, cross-sector effort.”_

In 2014, Joseph co-founded the Ethereum Project and founded ConsenSys to focus on building infrastructure, developer tools, and decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform.

_“I see deep parallels between the Ethereum ecosystem and the Filecoin ecosystem. As the Filecoin ecosystem grows, it will occupy a crucial role in the re-architecturing of the world’s information and economic systems. We’re only now really initiating the transition to a fully decentralized web space. I see the Filecoin Foundation as a way to accelerate that transition and make the decentralized web a reality, and I’m excited to be a part of it.”_

The mission of the Blockchain Association is to improve the public policy environment so that blockchain networks can thrive in the United States. Kristin sets the association’s public policy strategy and leads engagement with industry and outreach to policymakers.

_“The entire crypto space needs regulatory clarity and legislative support before it can truly flourish. Part of what we need to do, as innovators and blockchain supporters, is to go on the offensive and secure regulatory and legislative wins for crypto. Doing so starts with building a robust community network.”_

She is also the co-founder of iDisclose, a legal technology company focused on the disclosure and legal document needs of small business and startup entrepreneurs.

_“Fundamentally, building the decentralized web is about building back better for a new era of internet technology defined by fairness and equity. The centralized web systematically disempowers web users and tech companies from the world’s poorest and most underdeveloped regions. But decentralizing the web could change that.”_

_“People want to make their own decisions about what content they interact with and about how they distribute and share it. Only the decentralized web has the potential to fully distribute decisionmaking in this area and empower ordinary web users to choose for themselves. I’m incredibly excited to join the Filecoin Foundation and help change the way the world shares content.”_

She helps to steward the global movement to create a Decentralized Web, including producing the Decentralized Web Summits 2018 & 2016, DWeb Camp 2019.

_“I remember so vividly when Juan Benet first visited the Internet Archive back in 2015. Already, it was becoming apparent that the web we were inhabiting was failing us. We talked about a huge vision to bake our values into the code, to build the Web we want and deserve. By 2016, we had named it the Decentralized Web. It’s been amazing to watch the Decentralized Web evolve from something notional to hundreds of projects with working code. We’re entering a phase of phenomenal growth and real-world challenges.”_
