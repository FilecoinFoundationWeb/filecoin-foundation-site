[If you build it they will come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams). That’s the aim of Renovi, a metaverse marketplace and design studio that works with global brands and businesses to create, develop, and implement their Web3 strategies.

Through its platform, which connects architects, 3D designers and digital landowners, Renovi aims to be the go-to developer for creating a digital presence.

Unlike other cloud storage solutions, many of which can accommodate only JPEG or PNG files, the Filecoin network was attractive to Renovi because you can store large architectural files and 3D NFTs.

The Renovi marketplace currently offers functionality to create, read, update, and delete NFTs and user profiles. Future functionality, which will be enabled in part through a Filecoin Dev Grant, will include a more robust storage solution, an Ethereum bridge, the ability to collect on-platform and cross-platform royalties, upgradable smart contracts, and a DAO.

Renovi Studios has already become an established business in the Web3 space — developing and building metaverse and NFT strategies for leading brands in fashion, entertainment, sports, and hospitality.

Recently, Renovi supported brands including Diageo, DKNY, and GM, building their metaverse experiences at Decentraland’s Fashion Week. The brands leveraged Renovi’s design expertise to develop pop-up stores and brand activations. Some of these housed digital wearables — many of these digital assets could also be purchased as physical goods.

In Q1 of 2022, Renovi sponsored the largest virtual build-a-thon and startup competition, the Next Top Metaverse Build, which attracted more than 160 participants _with support and prizes from Decentraland, Sandbox and the guidance of the University of Nicosia_. Aimed at university students, architects and design professionals from around the world, the competition challenged participants to create virtual designs for categories including buildings, casinos, festival grounds, museums and NFT galleries.

Zachariades says in the future the metaverse will serve as a new source for freelance and consultative work. To help accelerate that, Renovi is cultivating a community of architects, 3D designers and artists in related fields who can showcase and solicit work via the platform.

“We are committed to supporting what is a very niche and specific market,” Zachariades said. “Architects and artists can be particular about their work, and because the files they produce are so large, quality is often sacrificed when uploaded to Web2 platforms. We want to empower architects and 3D designers and their ability to unleash their designs away from physical limitations, while still allowing the public to experience them.”
