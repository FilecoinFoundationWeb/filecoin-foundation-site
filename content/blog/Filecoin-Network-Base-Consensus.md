Against the backdrop of Consensus 2023, one of the largest annual crypto gatherings in the US, the Filecoin community converged at the Filecoin Network Base to highlight the builders, storage providers and storage clients bringing the project to life.

Across the week, more than 600 people visited the Network Base to co-work, network, and hear some amazing talks from folks within the Filecoin ecosystem and beyond.

**Day 1 - Gaming on Filecoin**

On our first day open to the public it was all about gaming on the Filecoin Network! We hosted a Chess meet up and watched some of our Gigabrains battle it out.

The rest of the evening featured a number of presentations on how Filecoin and the IPFS serve as foundations for immutable and interoperable web3 games.

Jacob Homanics, a former web2 developer who crossed over to web3, talked about the value proposition of this new model and how Filecoin and IPFS enable this new paradigm and from BZ on how Flow blockchain, Filecoin and Mocaverse by Animoca Brands are working together to simplify the blockchain gaming experience for casual players. Guests received an NFT for attendance and gained insights into the latest trends in blockchain gaming, while exploring the potential for these technologies to shape the industry's future.

The evening closed out with a talk from Leon Do, a software engineer for Open Source, on discovering the possibilities of the web3 gaming tech stack. He demoed his game built on IPFS, [IPFS FPS](https://ipfs-fps-website.on.fleek.co/).

**Day 2 - CryptoEconDay**

We had a packed house on Day Two for CryptoEconLab’s CryptoEconDay, gathering of web3 researchers and practitioners coming together to share findings, lessons learned and working together to answer some of the most pressing questions surrounding cryptoeconomics.

The day had a wide range of topics including:

- Reserve & Market Making in Web3
- ​​Goal Oriented Agent Based Modeling
- ​​Programmable & Decentralized Key Pairs
- ​​Emerging Use Cases of MEV
