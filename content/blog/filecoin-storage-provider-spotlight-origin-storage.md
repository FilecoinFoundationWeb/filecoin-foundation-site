_This is one in a series of periodic blog posts devoted to profiling Filecoin storage providers. In these posts, we examine what they bring to — and the benefits they derive from — the Filecoin ecosystem._

[Origin Storage](http://www.originstorage.io/) was founded in 2018 with a mission to provide underlying technology solutions for the Web3 ecosystem with safe, flexible, and reliable products and services. The company, an independent blockchain infrastructure platform, has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States.

In 2022, Origin signed on as a Filecoin notary, serving as a fiduciary for the Filecoin network. Notaries are entrusted to uphold the [Principles](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0003.md) of the Filecoin Plus program — responsibly allocating DataCap to help foster various use cases on Filecoin.

Today, Origin operates more than 10 internet data centers with 100,000+ managed servers capable of 600P+ of compute power, a capacity that grew more than 21x in 2021 and continues to expand.

For Origin’s leadership, the idea of decentralizing the storage and transmission of data is big. For them, it is the essence of the blockchain.

“What makes us more excited than earning a profit is the opportunity to participate in the making of Web3,” said Origin Storage CEO [Andy Guo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-guo-010408103/). “We are grateful to be born at a time when we are able to participate in the expansion of the blockchain and other activities that advance the progress of mankind. Even if we are not ultimately successful, our technical experiments and economic models will serve as valuable lessons for future generations.”

In addition to its work to grow Filecoin’s decentralized storage network, Origin Storage is working with others in the ecosystem to develop new tools and services that will strengthen the Filecoin community. Looking ahead, the company plans to establish a DAO in order to rally like-minded companies to identify, upload, and make findable new data sets to the chain.
