Join the Filecoin Foundation as we help develop Filecoin and related technologies. We’re planning to grow aggressively, and we’ll need people with a wide range of skillsets. If you are interested in Filecoin, open source projects, file storage, decentralization, global communities, or information preservation, we might need someone like you.

To apply for a position, send your resume to <a href="mailto:jobs@fil.org">jobs@fil.org</a> with a note about why you are a great fit. Don’t see the right position for you? Drop us a line anyway, telling us why we need someone like you.

We are a fully remote organization and consider candidates regardless of geographic location.
