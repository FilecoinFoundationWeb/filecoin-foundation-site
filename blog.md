## The Foundations’ Roles in the Filecoin Ecosystem
### Published May 1st, 2021

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned an independent foundation that would serve as the long-term governance body for the Filecoin ecosystem. Its mandate would be to grow an open ecosystem for decentralized storage and to give developers an open and sustainable platform to build, enhance and monetize those services.

Today, the Filecoin Foundation (FF) is an independent organization that facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds critical development projects, supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem, and advocates for Filecoin and the decentralized web. FF coordinates and supports the creation and improvement of open-source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.

The Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) focuses on charitable activities, including building and supporting the decentralized web community, funding research and development, and educating the public about the decentralized web.

The FF and FFDW combined have an allocation of 100 million FIL that vest linearly over 6 years beginning at network launch, as explained in the Filecoin PPM. FF and FFDW use FIL to support their missions as often as possible, and periodically convert a portion of their annual operating budgets from FIL to fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies to support project funding and to cover administrative expenses.

FF uses this allocation to support projects that further Filecoin’s core objectives to build, store, and mine, periodically making grants to third-party groups that have a vested interest in the success of the Filecoin network.

FFDW supports programs that help lay the foundation for the broader decentralized web, through sponsorships, education, and other programs. For example, FFDW supports Starling Labs, which brings together an array of disciplines to meet the technical and ethical challenges of establishing trust in the most sensitive digital records of our human history.

## Filecoin Foundation and Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web Gain Momentum

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned that an independent Filecoin Foundation would serve as the long-term governance body for the Filecoin Ecosystem. They gave the Foundation the mandate to “grow an open ecosystem for decentralized storage” and to “give developers an open and sustainable platform to build, enhance and monetize those services.” They wanted the Foundation to be modeled on Foundations for other open source projects like the Apache Software Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation and the Linux Foundation. 

In October,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sakannch1Dw&feature=emb_title"> we announced the details</a> of the <a href="https://fil.org/">Filecoin Foundation (FF)</a> and its mission. The Filecoin Foundation is an independent organization on a mission to accelerate the growth of Filecoin and related technologies to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information. The Foundation will build and support the Filecoin community. There are so many stakeholders in the Filecoin ecosystem: miners, developers, researchers, token holders, clients, users. We want to support all of them.  

The FF has a sister charitable organization, the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW). The mission of the FFDW is to ensure the permanent preservation of humanity’s most important information by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks.

We also  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OY4xAs3Grg&feature=emb_title">announced the incredible teams</a> making up the FF and FFDW in October, and those teams are <a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/filecoin-foundation-and-filecoin-foundation-for-the-decentralized-web-gain-momentum-76a51f3e7abc">continuing to grow</a>. 

In the next day or so, the FF and the FFDW will be receiving their first transfers of Filecoin tokens, totaling approximately 1 million FIL tokens for FF and 951,268 FIL tokens for FFDW. This represents a small percentage of the Foundations’ 100 million FIL allocation--as laid out in the <a href="https://coinlist.co/assets/index/filecoin_index/Protocol%20Labs%20-%20SAFT%20-%20Private%20Placement%20Memorandum-bbd65da01fdc4a15219c49ad20fb9e28681adec9fae744c41cccd124545c4c73.pdf">Filecoin PPM</a> --which the Foundations will continue to receive over time. 

Foundations are critical to the success of blockchain networks. They safeguard the network, drive governance, and promote ecosystem growth. We have ambitious missions, and we are thrilled to dive into the work. Follow our journeys on this blog. We look forward to sharing our progress with you!
