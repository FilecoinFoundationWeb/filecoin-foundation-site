## The foundation’s key role is to find ways for the Filecoin community to solve the problems we face as a community, and help facilitate collective action.

The Filecoin Foundation does not own Filecoin, operate it, or manage it. It is one of many organizations that cares deeply about Filecoin — its potential, and the values it represents. However, the foundation has a unique position within that ecosystem to help cultivate research, development, and community engagement. In addition to helping fund development of many significant components of the Filecoin ecosystem, the foundation supports a vibrant decentralized ecosystem with many independent organizations that provide funding, coordination, and leadership to support Filecoin’s long-term success.

The foundation’s key role is to find ways for the Filecoin community to solve the problems we face as a community, and help facilitate collective action. This means resisting the natural tendency of organizations to grow and accumulate value within themselves, and instead cultivating value creation outside the Foundation in the broader Filecoin ecosystem.
